<h2>Hometown</h2>

<p>	I waas born in Maryland and moved to Nyc when I was about 1. Before I turned 4, I moved to Lockport, a small city near Buffalo, NY. During my teens years I moved back and forth from Nyc and Lockport. A bit before Covid-19 started to spread in Nyc, I moved to Virgina. Instead of stay in a densely populated city, I had better chances of not geting in contact with Covid in a smaller city. Insted of having an exact location of a hometown, I liked to say "I'm a wander".</p>

<h2>Career Path</h2>

<p>	I'm currently in my 4th semester, majoring in Computer Information Systems. I am amming to obtain my associate's degree. I also plan on transfering to Queens College after. I havent decied if I want to get master's degree after getting a bachelor's degree, but I most likely will start going into the workfoce.</p>

<h2>Future Goals</h2>

<p>	My current short term academic goal is to recive a grade between A and B for all of my classses this semester. Another short term goal, that isn't related to academics or career is to created my own ideal/perfect bag. I find backpacks to have way to much space, and tote bages to be tiring to carry after awhile with no compartments to hold small items. A long term future goal would be to become a software engineer and create my own game. </p>
