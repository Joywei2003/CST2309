	  <p>1: Oddly the firsting I had thought of was going to a 7-Eleven in Korea. Convenience stores in Asian are very diffrent from the one in the US. Convenience stores within Korea have a variety of snack, meal and drink options. Along with that many convenience stores already have appaliances use as microwaves and printers. Convenience stores also sell things such as office supplies or home essentials. One thing I would try is the drinks with the ice in the cup with the drinks in the pouches.</p>
	  <p>2: Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. I would like to go see the palace wearing a hanbok, Korean traditional clothing.</p>
	  <p>3: Go to the Han river and drink soju. Before this one accident happending it was possible to drink near the river but now there are a few restrictions. </p>
	  <p>4:Go to a concert. Unlike the American maket with has tiers, in Korea every ticket is the same price with the same chances of geting a ticket. So why not go to a concert, did I mention its way cheaper.</p>
