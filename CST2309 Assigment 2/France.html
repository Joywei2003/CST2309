	  <p>1: One thing I have always wanted to do in France is to visit a local bakery and get a fresh baguette. In the US most breads are overly processed stuff that is made to with a long shelf life.</p>
      <p>2: Palace of Versailles, it's known for the Treaties of Versailles and as the home of past French Royal families. I have wanted to look at the main Chateau, the numerous fountains in the gardens and the many rooms.</p>
      <p>3: The Eiffel Tower. It screams France, but I honestly dont know why I want to go. Even before I started taking french class, I had been drawing 'La Tour Eiffel'.</p>

	  <p>1: Pastries/Desserts!!! 'a second stomach for sweets'... well normally people think of croissants, baguettes and crepes, but I would go for French macarons, Pate a Choux, and Eclairs.</p>
      <p>2: Coffee, I have hearn that french coffee is more bitter than american coffee but I would still like to try.</p>
	  <P>3: Escargot(snails). Since I'm there why not try it. I also seen some pictures of them and they look similar to this one thing my parents like.</P>
