    <h3>Why</h3>
     <p>I stumble across kpop in 2013, and fell in love with kpop 2019. One of the first groups I was into was Wanna One. Currently I'm into Stray Kids. Kpop albums and concerts in South Korea are way cheaper. Along with that I'm also intrested in Korean culture and food.</p>

    <h3>Why</h3>
     <p>Japan was on the top of my list for a few years. Seoul, South Korea replaced it last year. Anime and manga were a few things that made me intrested in Japanese culture. There are many reasons why I have been wanting to go to Japan. Besides culture and food, I am amazed at the technology put in to make Japanese stationary. Japanese stationary is much cheaper to get and easier to find in Japan.</p>
