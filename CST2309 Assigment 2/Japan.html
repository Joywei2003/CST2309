 	  <p>1: Sakura Veiwing!!! Sakura season in Japan is between March and April. Even though there are cherry blossoms in NYC, see the sakura and having a picnic under a sakura tree will be a diffrent experince.</p>
      <p>2: I want to go to an anime/manga related event such as AnimeJapan or Comiket</p>
      <p>3: I want to take a bullet train in Japan. For example a ride from Tokyo to Kyoto would take about 2 hours and 15 mins which is about equivelent to how long it takes me to get to school using nyc's MTA from my home.</p>
	  <p>4: 7-Eleven in Japan aswell. They also have a variety of snack, meal and drink options. Along with that many convenience stores already have appaliances use as microwaves and printers. Convenience stores also sell things such as office supplies or home essentials. Almost forgot to mention convenience stores have seationg inside! I would try the variety of bentos, onigiri and cup noodles(ramen, soba, yakisoba).</p>
	  <p>5: Akihabara and Shibuya. Akihabara is the center of Otaku culture. Shibuya is the center of youth fashion, many fashion and entertainment trends were born there.</p>
